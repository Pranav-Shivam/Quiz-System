        <h1>What is Java?</h1>
        <p>Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.<br>

            It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.<br>

            It is used for:<br>

            Mobile applications (specially Android apps)<br>
            Desktop applications<br>
            Web applications<br>
            Web servers and application servers<br>
            Games<br>
            Database connection<br>
            And much, much more!</p>
        <h1>Why Use Java?</h1>
        <p>Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)<br>
            It is one of the most popular programming language in the world<br>
            It is easy to learn and simple to use<br>
            It is open-source and free<br>
            It is secure, fast and powerful<br>
            It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)<br>
            Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
            As Java is close to C++ and C#<br> it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa</p>
        <h1>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages.</h1>
        <p>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.<br>
           <br> Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types(like int, char, etc)<br>
           <br> The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.<br>
           <br> Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.<br>
           <br> Java is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java-based),<br> desktop applications, web applications, client-server applications, enterprise applications, and many more.<br>
           <br> When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow <br>many things which may lead to bad/inefficient programming<br> if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives are always references in Java<br>. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions,<br> we always pass references in Java. One more example,<br> since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.
           <br> When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are written in<br> Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs <br>and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, but Python does not.</p>

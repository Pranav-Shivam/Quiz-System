        <h1>What is Python?</h1>
        <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

            <br>It is used for:

            <br>web development (server-side),
            <br>software development,
            <br> mathematics,
            <br>system scripting.</p>
        <h1>What can Python do?</h1>
        <p>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
            <br> Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
            <br> Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
            <br>Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
            <br> Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</p>
        <h1>Why Python?</h1>
        <p>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
            <br> Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
            <br> Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
            <br> Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
            <br> Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</p>
        <h1>Good to know</h1>
        <p>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated <br> with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
            <br> In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as <br> Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</p>
        <h1>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages</h1>
        <p>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.<br> 
            <br>  Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.<br> 
            <br>  Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.<br>  Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>
